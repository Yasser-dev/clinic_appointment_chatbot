## App Description

The Clinic Appointment Booking App is a test application designed to explore the capabilities of Dialogflow, a natural language understanding platform developed by Google. The app utilizes a combination of Flutter for the frontend, DialogFlowtter for chatbot integration, and Cloud Functions (Firebase) with the Google Calendar API for backend functionality.

Using the app, users can interact with a chatbot assistant to book appointments at a clinic. The chatbot understands natural language queries and guides users through the appointment booking process. It collects information such as name, phone number, email, preferred date, and time. The app then checks for appointment availability using the Google Calendar API and creates a calendar event for the booked appointment.

The primary focus of this app was to learn and experiment with Dialogflow's capabilities in a practical setting. By integrating Dialogflow with Flutter and Cloud Functions, the app showcases how natural language processing can be leveraged to automate appointment booking workflows.

Please note that this app was developed as a learning exercise and may not be a fully polished and production-ready application.
